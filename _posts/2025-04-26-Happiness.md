Happiness?

![Quote](/assets/img/kant-quote.png)

This quote is often attributed to Immnauel kant, but some attribute it to Alexander Chalmers as well. 

I donot think you can define happiness with just a bunch of rules. Same goes for any human emotion. But, ever since I came across this quote,it stuck with me and I have often it as a rubric for happiness.It's not perfect, but it's a good rule of thumb.
