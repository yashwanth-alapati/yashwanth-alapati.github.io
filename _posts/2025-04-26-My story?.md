When I was a kid, I always knew what I wanted to be after growing up, which is to study hard, make money and make my parents proud. Perhaps, that is the way it is for most kids growing up in a typical middle class family. In general, for any one, I think we are all just trying to climb the social ladder in some way or the other. A lot can change, when you find something beautiful along the way and for me that was physics during high school.I loved it so much, I dropped going to college and just stayed at home to study physics. You obsessively study enough physics, you realize it's the only thing that matters. All is atoms and void-right?. Well, though I loved it, I knew I wasnt smart enough to pursue it at a higher level. I just pursued engineering instead.
