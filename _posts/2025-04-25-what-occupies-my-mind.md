**I ponder about this most of the time:**

"All is atoms and void" is an over simplification, but Democritus wasn't wrong. However, it begs the question- if that is true then what's the point of anything?. With time, complex structures have emerged from galaxies, stars, planets to life, society, emotions...etc. It's really beautiful and I think it's what makes our lives interesting. But what I don't like is the fact that the time scale is usually in millions to billions of years. Then, it begs the only question- Do I even matter? And, this is what I ponder about a lot of the time. 

Imagine all the world's knowledge, books, art, science ....


Living in 21st century, with the internet, we have access to almost all of the world's knowledge and with AI, we have the ability to comprehend that knowledge at ease.That makes us really powerful, but I often find myself overwhelmed. I think the real challenge then is not about how much you can learn, but it's about distilling out what you want to learn and what you want to do with it.

I attribute a lof of my attitudes and perspectives towards technology to the book "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" By Richard Hamming.I love this analogy from the book:

* "It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about root(n) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance root(n).In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen."

As I write this on Apr 25 2025, I am in search of a vision that I can so obsessively chase.


<!-- 
I often learn a lot just by working with amazing people. If you and your team are chasing a vision-Tell me about it.


 If I were to distill all my thoughts together and come up with one sentence about what's the best thing to do in life, it can't be better than this.

"Lastly, in a sense, this is a religious course—I am preaching the message that, with apparently only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably—that the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal for your life." -->
