This is Yashwanth Alapati,but almost all call me 'Yash'. I like to introduce myself as a dreamer, because most of the time I ponder what the world will look like in 15...20 years' time.

- I like coding, Math and a bit of Physics. Outside that, I enjoy lifting weights, Long runs and challenging physical endeavours.
- Reading is a habit I am always working on. Check out the books I read.
- The primary goal of this website is to voice and timestamp my thoughts and ideas. I understand we live in the Intelligence Age and I do not intend to use an LLM for content generation, hence the possible grammatical errs.
- PS: Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only.
