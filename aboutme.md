This is Yashwanth Alapati, but almost everyone prefers 'Yash'. I like to introduce myself as a dreamer, because most of the time I ponder what the world will look like in 15...20 years' time.

- I like coding, Math and a bit of Physics. Outside that, I enjoy lifting weights, Long runs and challenging physical endeavours.
- Reading is a habit I am always working on. Check out the [books](https://github.com/yashwanth-alapati/Books) I read.

The primary goal of this website is to share and timestamp my thoughts and ideas. I understand we live in the Intelligence Age and I do not intend to use an LLM for content generation, hence the sloppy errors here and there.
**PS:** Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only. 



### Let's talk?

If you have a stimulating idea or just want to share about something we have in common shoot me a "Hello" at [yashalap6966@gmail.com](yashalap6966@gmail.com).
