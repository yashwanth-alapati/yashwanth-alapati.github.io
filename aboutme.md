This is Yashwanth Alapati. I like to introduce myself as a dreamer, because most of the time I ponder what the world will look like in 15...20 years time.

- I like to write code and build projects.
- I am getting my Masters degree in CS at NYU
- I enjoying lifting weights, Long runs and challenging physical pursuits.
- Reading is a habit I am always working on and do check out the books I read.
- I use this website to write my thoughts. I understand we live in the Intelligence Age and words have less credibility. I do not intend to use an LLM for any content, however I will use it to write code for the website.
- Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only.
