This is Yashwanth Alapati. I like to introduce myself as a dreamer, because most of the time I ponder what the world will look like in 15...20 years' time.

- I like coding, Math and a bit of Physics. Outside that, I enjoy lifting weights, Long runs and challenging physical endeavours.
- Reading is a habit I am always working on.

The primary goal of this website is to share and timestamp my thoughts and ideas. I won't be using an LLM, becuase writing is something I truly enjoying doing, so ignore the sloppy errors here and there.<br>
**PS:** Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only. 



### Let's talk?
