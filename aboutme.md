title: About me
---

I like to read, I like to think, I like to write.I'd say that's a pretty good summary of me. I spend most of my time building, writing code , learning Math and a bit of Physics. Outside that- I enjoy lifting weights, going on long runs and challenging myself with physical endeavours.

The primary goal of this website is to share and timestamp my thoughts. I will use GPT only like a tool/dictionary/encyclopedia to help me with tasks like finding words, but the content and the ideas will be written by me. I truly enjoy writing as a therapeutic hobby and I'm not letting GPT take that away from me. So ignore, if I make sloppy errors here and there!<br>

**PS:** Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only. 



### Let's talk?

If you have a stimulating idea or just want to share about something we have in common, shoot me a "Hi" at [My Personal mail](mailto:yashalap6966@gmail.com).
