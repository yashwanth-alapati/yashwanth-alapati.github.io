title: About me

This is Yashwanth Alapati. 

A bit about me:
- I like coding, Math and a bit of Physics. Outside that, I enjoy lifting weights, Long runs and challenging physical endeavours.
- Reading is a habit I am always working on.

The primary goal of this website is to share and timestamp my thoughts and ideas. I won't be using GPT, becuase writing is something I truly enjoy, so ignore the sloppy errors here and there.<br>
**PS:** Content on this Website are my personal ruminations only. 



### Let's talk?

If you have a stimulating idea or just want to share about something we have in common, shoot me a "Hi" at [My Personal mail](mailto:yashalap6966@gmail.com).
